        <h3>What is Doctor Who?</h3>
        <p class="exp">&nbsp;Doctor Who is a TV series about an alien, known mainly as The Doctor, who flies around time and space in a police box that is bigger on the inside, known as the Tardis.
            <br>He goes to worlds and galaxies, one time even a different universe, and has some pretty crazy adventures with a companion he brings with.</p>
        <h3>The Doctor's Main Enemies</h3>
        <ul class="enemyList">
            <li><b>Daleks</b> and their unending hatred for anything other than Daleks, and their persuit to crush said lesser beings</li>
            <li><b>Cybermen</b> and their unending persuit of converting more and more humans into themselves; emotionally hollow and of metal</li>
            <li>Last but by far not the least; <b>The Master</b>, childhood friend and fellow Timelord to The Doctor, who finds great delight in tormenting him in a plethora of different ways</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What I Like About the Series</h3>
        <p class="likes">&nbsp;What I like about the series is how crazy things get. From witches to mummies, spacemen to flying fish... I like how he tries to tackle things with the perspective, "let's just see what happens, because why not?".
