            <h2>What is Doctor Who?</h2>
            <p>Doctor Who is a TV series about an alien, known mainly as The Doctor, who flies around time and space in a police box that is bigger on the inside, known as the Tardis.
                <br>He goes to worlds and galaxies, one time even a different universe, and has some pretty crazy adventures with a companion he brings with.</p>

            <h2>The Doctor's Main Enemies</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Daleks and their unending hatred for anything other than Daleks, and their persuit to crush said lesser beings</li>
                <li>Cybermen and their unending persuit of converting more and more humans into themselves; emotionally hollow and of metal</li>
                <li>Last but by far not the least; The Master, childhood friend and fellow Timelord to The Doctor, who finds great delight in tormenting him in a plethora of different ways</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What I Like About the Series</h2>
            <p>What I like about the series is how crazy things get. From witches to mummies, spacemen to flying fish... I like how he tries to tackle things with the perspective, "let's just see what happens, because why not?".</p>
